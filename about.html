            <h2>Clinical profile</h2>
         
            <p>
              Dr. Hussein has experience managing a broad spectrum of pediatric gastrointestinal and
              hepatobiliary conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, intestinal
              lymphangiectasia, complex constipation and fecal incontinence, reflux and vomiting syndromes,
              and acute and chronic GI bleeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              His practice is strongly shaped by the interface between gut health, nutrition and
              neurodevelopment. He has particular interest in feeding difficulties, selective and restrictive
              eating, obesity and metabolic risk, and gastrointestinal issues in children with
              neurodevelopmental conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Hussein aims to provide care that is technically sound and evidence-based, but also
              practical and compassionate. Each visit emphasizes clear explanations, shared decision-making
              with families and attention to how chronic GI symptoms affect growth, development, schooling
              and quality of life.
            </p>

              teaching, and developed innovative formats such as podcast-based case discussions.

              and treat every child with dignity, patience and respect.
